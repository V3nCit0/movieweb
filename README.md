# MovieWeb

A Netflix-inspired single-page experience with a hero banner, curated rows, and an admin panel to publish new movies with embedded players from third-party providers.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Browse the **Home** and **Library** tabs to explore the catalogue.
3. Use the **Admin** tab to add a new title with poster, metadata, and an embed URL (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, or your streaming provider). Movies are saved locally in your browser for demo purposes.

## Features
- Dark, cinematic UI with horizontal rows and a responsive grid.
- Inline video player modal that loads the provided embed URL.
- Category filtering and title/year sorting in the library view.
- Admin form to quickly publish new titles without code changes.
